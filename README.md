# My Token

Simple overview of use/purpose: This Solidity smart contract implements a basic ERC20-like token (`MyToken`) with functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens.

## Description

`MyToken` is a basic implementation of a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionality to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens, managing balances using mappings. The contract starts with a total supply of 0 and allows for dynamic minting and burning of tokens as needed.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To download and interact with the `MyToken` smart contract:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

  
   git clone https://github.com/Prqkhar/My-Token/edit/main/README.md

Based on the provided Solidity smart contract for MyToken, here's a filled-in template for a README.md file:
